# Welcome to `@publica.re/react-git-taskbar`

`@publica.re/react-git-taskbar` is a all-in-one component allowing you to offer a git backend to your users.

It also allows you to get a finer control over your interface with specialized components.

## Install

With yarn,

```
yarn add @publica.re/react-git-taskbar
```

Remember that we depend on `@publica.re/react-git-provider`, and that it can be used anywhere in your app when `@publica.re/react-git-taskbar` is used. See [how](https://@publica.re/react-git-provider.publica.re) !

## Usage

Note that all components, except `<TaskBar />` require a `<Git.Provider />` in order to work.

## Use along with Gitlab

If you want to use Gitlab (only remote supported for now), you have to set a OAuth key in your environement as `REACT_APP_GITLAB_OAUTH_KEY`. If that is not done properly, it may cause crashes.
